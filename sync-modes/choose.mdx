## Which sync mode should you use?

    > 10x better than direct webhooks but still a webhook

    If you don't want to move away from webhooks but you want a much better webhook experience then this mode is for you. This is the sync mode that is available in our open source version.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Instant Access" icon="zap">
    > Ditch webhooks and fetch on demand

    If you have been waiting to move away from webhooks as much as possible, then this option is for you. Using our API/SDK, you can directly access live Stripe data without worrying about being rate limited or throttled.

    {/* and an overly complicated SDK that is overkill for 90% of the use cases. */}

    {/* so you never need to wait for a webhook again. */}

  <Step title="Deep Sync" icon="database-zap">
    > Stripe data, in your own database. Set it up and forget Sanebase. âœ¨

    If you would rather query and reference Stripe data within your own database, directly from your application code (who wouldn't want to?), then chose this. Real-time Stripe data will stream into secure dedicated tables in your database so you can use it just like other data.
