title: Deep Sync
---

Deep Sync allows you to get LIVE Stripe data inside your own database.

- âœ…&nbsp; LIVE Stripe data in your DB
- âœ…&nbsp; Sanebase streams to dedicated tables
- âœ…&nbsp; Scoped authentication &ndash; Sanebase has access ONLY to these specific tables and nothing else
- âœ…&nbsp; Directly reference Stripe data from your other tables
  - âœ…&nbsp; You can finally foreign key from `workspace` to `stripe_customer` maintaining referential integrity!
- âœ…&nbsp; Direct access to Stripe tables in your application code
- âœ…&nbsp; No need to maintain Stripe state in your product / database
- âœ…&nbsp; No need to write custom logic to keep Stripe synced with your app
- âœ…&nbsp; Set it up once and you're done
- âœ…&nbsp; Forget that there was ever something called Stripe webhooks ðŸŽ‰

(More coming soon)
