**Keep your app in sync with Stripe without going mad**

{/* Sanebase processes Stripe webhooks on your behalf so you don't have to write custom logic to keep Stripe synced with your app. */}

Sanebase simplifies the process of keeping your app in sync with Stripe using various methods that are used in production by established engineering teams.

You get all of that magic with a few lines of code, without the complexity of maintaining it yourself, at a fraction of the cost or free.
