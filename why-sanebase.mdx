If you've ever processed real customer transactions in production, even at a small scale, you already know what a nightmare it is to stay in sync.

## Webhooks &mdash; icebergs that will sink your Stripe integration

Webhooks look deceptively simple at first. Wire up an endpoint to receive updates and you're done, right? Not so fast.

In reality, there are so many things that can (and will) go wrong:

/>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Each user operation triggers a cascade of webhooks">
    A single Stripe subscription update can fire 10+ webhooks across different
    objects (customer, subscription, invoice, payment method). Your endpoint
    gets flooded with partial updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Webhooks arrive out of order">
    Stripe webhooks are not ordered, so the last webhook you receive might not
    contain the current state. Your database ends up with stale data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Webhook payloads are incomplete">
    Most webhooks only contain the changed fields, not the complete object
    state. You're left piecing together the full picture from multiple events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Network failures create data inconsistencies">
    When your server is down or times out, you miss critical updates. Your
    internal state drifts from the source of truth.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Debugging webhook issues is a nightmare">
    Failed webhooks, duplicate events, and missing data create support tickets
    that are hard to trace and fix.
  </Step>
  {/* <Step title="Each integration adds complexity">
    Supporting Stripe, Auth0, SendGrid, and other services means maintaining separate webhook handlers, each with their own quirks and failure modes.
  </Step> */}
</Steps>

## Attempts to "solve" this

Most developers throw a webhook gateway in front of their webhook endpoint and call it a day. This is a common pattern, and it has a few upsides, such as retries, where the gateway will retry failed webhooks. But it once again leaves you with the same issues as before, such as partial updates, out of order events, and more.

## Enter Sanebase

Sanebase makes it stupidly simple to keep your app in sync with Stripe.

For example, in our [Unified Ingest mode](sync-modes/unified-ingest/overview), it acts as an intelligent middleware layer between Stripe and your application. Instead of dealing with raw webhooks, you get clean, consolidated data updates.

Sanebase also has [other sync modes](sync-modes/index) which let you **ditch webhooks completely**.
