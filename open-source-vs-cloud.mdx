## Cost breakdown

### Open source

- Cloudflare Workers -> \$0 or \$5/mo+
- Neon Postgres -> \$0 or \$20/mo+
- Maintenance cost -> \$1,200/month or ~16 hours/month
  - Sanebase is built with minimal maintenance in mind.
  - So lets say, 1 engineer spends 4 hours a week on maintenance.
  - Engineer's hourly rate: \$75/hour (varies by country; adjust as needed).
  - Weekly Cost: 4 hours x \$75 = \$300/week
  - Monthly Cost: \$300 x 4 = \$1,200/month

### Cloud

- Start for free, stay free till you exceed some minimum ARR.
- Pricing scales as your transactions increase
- Costs \$20/mo per 100K ARR
  - Even at \$1M ARR, you pay only \$200/mo to eliminate serious state-sync chaos.
  - Once you cross \$1M+ ARR, maintenance time/cost skyrockets debugging sync issues.
- You're not paying for a webhook gateway, your paying for proper state management, peace of mind and freedom from debugging Stripe webhooks.
